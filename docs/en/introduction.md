# Introduction

Welcome to the `PetaBencana.id_BulkDownloader` repository. This suite of Python scripts is developed to facilitate the bulk downloading of disaster data from the PetaBencana.id API. It is aimed at researchers, developers, and analysts who need to process and analyze large amounts of disaster-related data efficiently.

PetaBencana.id is a platform that harnesses the power of social media and crowd-sourced reporting to gather, sort, and display information about disasters in real time. The API provides access to this valuable data, and with the scripts in this repository, users can:

- Automate the retrieval of data over a range of dates.
- Process and clean data to exclude non-relevant information.
- Combine multiple JSON files into a single file for easier analysis.
- Flatten nested JSON structures for compatibility with various data analysis tools.
- Convert JSON to GeoJSON for use in geographical information systems.

This repository is structured to help you get started quickly and includes documentation in both English and Bahasa Indonesia.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python and data formats like JSON and GeoJSON.
- An understanding of API interaction and web requests.

For more information on how to set up and use these scripts, please refer to the `installation.md` and `how_to_use.md` documentation.

Thank you for choosing PetaBencana.id_BulkDownloader for your data processing needs.
